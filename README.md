# KlerosJurorsDashboard
This page lets you know your chances to be drawn as a Juror in a Kleros Court. It also shows you the evolution of cases, along with history of the Courts.

You can visit the dashboard in https://kokialgo.pythonanywhere.com

Please open an issue if you found any, or improvements feedbacks.

This Dashboard was inspired by the Kleroscan tool developed by Marc Zeller.

I would like to Thank You all the Kleros team for the support in the development, specially to William George who help me with the mathematics.
